    I wish to dedicate this thesis not to the usual suspects (not my wife or parents, my friends or teachers) but to those who I have had my mind on for a long time, the ones who will benefit the most from scientific discovery and from the vast accomplishments achieved today.\break I dedicate it, rather, to the ones who will linger after us and so reap the benefits of our hard work.\break\hfil\break To my future children!
